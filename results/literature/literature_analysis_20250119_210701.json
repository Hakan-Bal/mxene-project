These compounds are especially promising for use\nas pseudocapacitive electrodes due to their ability to convert energy\nelectrochemically at fast rates. Using voltage-dependent cluster expansion\nmodels, we predict the charge storage performance of MXene pseudocapacitors for\na range of electrode compositions. $M_3C_2O_2$ electrodes based on group-VI\ntransition metals have up to 80% larger areal energy densities than\nprototypical titanium-based ( e.g. $Ti_3C_2O_2$) MXene electrodes. We attribute\nthis high pseudocapacitance to the Faradaic voltage windows of group-VI MXene\nelectrodes, which are predicted to be 1.2 to 1.8 times larger than those of\ntitanium-based MXenes. The size of the pseudocapacitive voltage window\nincreases with the range of oxidation states that is accessible to the MXene\ntransition metals. By similar mechanisms, the presence of multiple ions in the\nsolvent (Li$^+$ and H$^+$) leads to sharp changes in the transition-metal\noxidation states and can significantly increase the charge capacity of MXene\npseudocapacitors.",

The\ndegradation efficiency of methyl orange by g-C3N4@V2C MXene photocatalyst was\nas high as 94.5%, which is 1.56 times higher than that by g-C3N4. This was\nattributed to the V2C MXene inhibiting the rapid recombination of\nphotogenerated carriers and facilitating rapid transfer of photogenerated\nelectrons (e) from g-C3N4 to MXene. Moreover, g-C3N4@V2C MXene photocatalyst\nshowed good cycling stability. The photocatalytic performance was higher than\n85% after three cycles.

In this context,\nvarious MXenes have shown magnetic properties suitable for applications in\nspintronics, yet the number of MXenes reported so far is far smaller than their\nparental MAX phases. Therefore, we have studied the structural, electronic and\nmagnetic properties of bimetallic and vacancy-ordered MXenes derived from a new\n$(V_{2/3}Zr_{1/3})_2AlC $ MAX phase to assess whether MXene exfoliation would\nreturn stable magnetic materials. In particular, we have investigated the\nproperties of pristine and surface-functionalized $(V_{2/3}Zr_{1/3})_2CX_2$\nbimetallic and $(V_{2/3} \\square_{1/3})_2CX2$ vacancy-ordered MXenes with X =\nO, F and OH. Our density functional theory (DFT) calculations showed that\nmodifying the MXene stoichiometry and/or MXene surface functionalization\nchanges MXene properties. After testing all possible combinations of metallic\nmotifs and functionalization, we identified $V_{2/3}Zr_{1/3})_2CX_2$,\n$(V_{2/3}\\square_{1/3})_2CF_2$ and $(V_{2/3}\\square_{1/3})_2C(OH)_2$ as stable\nstructures. Among them, $(V_{2/3}Zr_{1/3})_2CO_2$ MXene is predicted to be an\nFM intrinsic half-semiconductor with a remarkably high Curie temperature\n($T_C$)) of 270 K. The $(V_{2/3}Zr_{1/3})_2C(OH)_2$ MXene exhibits a rather low\nwork function (WF) (1.37 eV) and is thus a promising candidate for ultra-low\nwork function electron emitters. Conversely, the $(V_{2/3}\\square_{1/3})_2CF_2$\nMXene has a rather high WF and hence can be used as a hole injector for\nSchottky-barrier-free contact applications. Overall, our proof-of-concept study\nshows that theoretical predictions of MXene exfoliation and properties support\nfurther experimental research towards developing spintronics devices.",

Electrochemical cycling\ninvestigations in combination with Ti 1s X-ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS)\nhave therefore been performed with the objective to study oxidation state\nchanges during potential variations. In some of these studies Ti3C2Tx has shown\nmain edge shifts in the Ti 1s X-ray absorption near-edge structure (XANES).\nHere we show that these main edge shifts originate from the Ti 4p orbital\ninvolvement in the bonding between the surface Ti and the termination species\nat the fcc-sites. The study further shows that the t2g-eg crystal field\nsplitting (10Dq) observed in the pre-edge absorption region indicate weaker\nTi-C bonds in Ti2CTx and Ti3C2Tx compared to TiC and the corresponding MAX\nphases. The results from this study provide information necessary for improved\nelectronic modeling and subsequently a better description of the materials\nproperties of the MXenes.

Their appealing potentials in several\naforementioned areas are experimentally demonstrated.

Due to the lack of spectral selectivity in intrinsic\nmaterials, such counter-intuitive properties are generally realized by\nconstructing complicated subwavelength metamaterials with costly\nnanofabrication techniques. Here we report the low mid-IR emissivity (down to\n10%) of 2D Ti3C2Tx MXenes. Associated with a high solar absorptance (up to\n90%), they embrace the best spectral selectivity among the reported intrinsic\nblack solar absorbing materials. Their appealing potentials in several\naforementioned areas are experimentally demonstrated. First-principles\ncalculations reveal that the IR emissivity of MXenes relies on both the\nnanoflake orientations and terminal groups, indicating great tunability. The\ncalculations also suggest that more MXenes including Ti2CTx, Nb2CTx, and V2CTx\nare also potential low-emissivity materials. This work opens the avenue to\nfurther exploration of a family of intrinsically low-emissivity materials with\nover 70 members.",

In this context,\nvarious MXenes have shown magnetic properties suitable for applications in\nspintronics, yet the number of MXenes reported so far is far smaller than their\nparental MAX phases. Therefore, we have studied the structural, electronic and\nmagnetic properties of bimetallic and vacancy-ordered MXenes derived from a new\n$(V_{2/3}Zr_{1/3})_2AlC $ MAX phase to assess whether MXene exfoliation would\nreturn stable magnetic materials. In particular, we have investigated the\nproperties of pristine and surface-functionalized $(V_{2/3}Zr_{1/3})_2CX_2$\nbimetallic and $(V_{2/3} \\square_{1/3})_2CX2$ vacancy-ordered MXenes with X =\nO, F and OH. Our density functional theory (DFT) calculations showed that\nmodifying the MXene stoichiometry and/or MXene surface functionalization\nchanges MXene properties. After testing all possible combinations of metallic\nmotifs and functionalization, we identified $V_{2/3}Zr_{1/3})_2CX_2$,\n$(V_{2/3}\\square_{1/3})_2CF_2$ and $(V_{2/3}\\square_{1/3})_2C(OH)_2$ as stable\nstructures. Among them, $(V_{2/3}Zr_{1/3})_2CO_2$ MXene is predicted to be an\nFM intrinsic half-semiconductor with a remarkably high Curie temperature\n($T_C$)) of 270 K. The $(V_{2/3}Zr_{1/3})_2C(OH)_2$ MXene exhibits a rather low\nwork function (WF) (1.37 eV) and is thus a promising candidate for ultra-low\nwork function electron emitters. Conversely, the $(V_{2/3}\\square_{1/3})_2CF_2$\nMXene has a rather high WF and hence can be used as a hole injector for\nSchottky-barrier-free contact applications. Overall, our proof-of-concept study\nshows that theoretical predictions of MXene exfoliation and properties support\nfurther experimental research towards developing spintronics devices.",

The density\nfunctional theory (DFT) calculations were carried out to study the magnetic\nmoments of V$_2$C-OF and MnO$_2$@V$_2$C-OF MXene. The MXene, which is derived\nfrom the exfoliation of its parent V$_2$AlC MAX phase, shows a good potential\nto be a ferromagnetic when MnO$_2$ is adsorbed on it. The V$_2$C MXene and\nMnO$_2$ adsorbed V$_2$C MXene were successfully synthesized, as characterized\nusing X-ray diffraction, showing an increased c-lattice parameter from\n22.6{\\AA} to 27.2{\\AA} after MnO$_2$ adsorption.

The in-plane Young's moduli of Tin+1Nn are larger\nthan those of Tin+1Cn, whereas in both systems they decrease with the increase\nof the monolayer thickness. Cohesive energy calculations indicate that MXenes\nwith a larger monolayer thickness have a better structural stability.\nAdsorption energy calculations imply that Tin+1Nn have stronger preference to\nadhere to the terminal groups, which suggests more active surfaces for\nnitride-based MXenes. More importantly, nearly free electron states are\nobserved to exist outside the surfaces of -OH functionalized carbide/nitride\nbased MXenes, especially in Tin+1Nn(OH)2, which provide almost perfect\ntransmission channels without nuclear scattering for electron transport. The\noverall electrical conductivity of nitride-based MXenes is determined to be\nhigher than that of carbide-based MXenes. The exceptional properties of\ntitanium nitride-based MXenes, including strong surface adsorption, high\nelastic constant and Young's modulus, and good metallic conductivity, make them\npromising materials for catalysis and energy storage applications.",

These compounds are especially promising for use\nas pseudocapacitive electrodes due to their ability to convert energy\nelectrochemically at fast rates. Using voltage-dependent cluster expansion\nmodels, we predict the charge storage performance of MXene pseudocapacitors for\na range of electrode compositions. $M_3C_2O_2$ electrodes based on group-VI\ntransition metals have up to 80% larger areal energy densities than\nprototypical titanium-based ( e.g. $Ti_3C_2O_2$) MXene electrodes. We attribute\nthis high pseudocapacitance to the Faradaic voltage windows of group-VI MXene\nelectrodes, which are predicted to be 1.2 to 1.8 times larger than those of\ntitanium-based MXenes. The size of the pseudocapacitive voltage window\nincreases with the range of oxidation states that is accessible to the MXene\ntransition metals. By similar mechanisms, the presence of multiple ions in the\nsolvent (Li$^+$ and H$^+$) leads to sharp changes in the transition-metal\noxidation states and can significantly increase the charge capacity of MXene\npseudocapacitors.",
